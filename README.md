# SeminarioDeProyectos_WordCount

The aim of the project is to practice working with a GitHub repository as part of a team.

You will each need to Fork your own version of the project, using modifications to the provided code to generate your own data and then add this data back to the repository so that analysis can be performed on the combined data of the whole group.

Specifically, you will be finding the frequency of the most common words in your favorite book and saving this information in a CSV file. We will then analyze the frequency of the most common words across all the chosen books.

Steps:

1) Fork a version of the repository to your local machine.

2) Ideally, practice using branches whilst making your modifications.

3) Test that the python notebook file "html_scraping_bookwordcount.ipynb" runs with the preset example (install any required packages). [If cannot run locally, try uploading to: https://colab.research.google.com/ ]

4) Change the code to run for your favorite book (or any book of your choice) and save a CSV file

5) Merge the repository with the original so that the generated CSV can be accessed by everyone

6) Once the CSV files are ready, use "readCSV_wordcounts.ipynb" to merge the datasets and produce a figure displaying the most frequently occuring words
